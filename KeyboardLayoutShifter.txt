A small project of mine: A better applet to select (and see!) what keyboard
layout you are using in your GNOME session: KeyboardLayoutShifter

I spend more time on writing this text than on the applet itself, so use at your
own risk :).

** Default keyboard layout indicator **

The current GNOME keyboard layout indicator has some problems:
+ In gnome-terminal ctrl- keystrokes are taken from the first layout in the
  list. So if you use two or more layouts, you should rearrange the order every
  time you want to switch.
+ It doesn't actually indicate which layout you use. I've got two layouts,
  dvorak and US international. Both list as 'USA', which makes the 'indicator'
  aspect useless.

The GNOME community seems to be divided about these issues, and it might
not be fixed soon. See https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=162726


** The Keyboard Layout Shifter **

I have thought about learning how to make a panel applet before, and this seemed
to be the perfect opportunity. So I put together a small python applet that
cycles ('shifts') through the list of layouts listed in gconf. The used one is
always on the top so you can use your ctrl- keystrokes. Plus, it actually shows
you what layout you have chosen!


** Installing **

There are three files in the tarball, that you have to copy manually.
+ GNOME_KeyboardLayoutShifter_Factory.server 
  contains the definition of the applet and goes into 
  /usr/lib/bonobo/servers
+ KeyboardLayoutShifter.py 
  is the actual program and goes into 
  /usr/local/bin 
+ KeyboardLayoutShifter.txt 
  is this text file.

Just put the 2 files in the tarball in their respective positions, add the
applet somewhere, and you're good to go! Like

 tar -xzvf KeyboardLayoutShifter-0.1.tar.gz
 cd KeyboardLayoutShifter-0.1
 sudo cp -avi GNOME_KeyboardLayoutShifter_Factory.server /usr/lib/bonobo/servers
 sudo cp -avi KeyboardLayoutShifter.py /usr/local/bin

Or you can try out the applet by running the python script (with -d).


** Acknowledgements **

I never had made a GNOME applet before, let alone a slightly useful one. The
blog posts of these two people helped me on my way. Actually, you could say it
is just a mashup of their examples :).

Nice sidenote: Originally I just edited the HinduScroller that presented random
english-hindu words every 10 seconds but in such a way that it changed my
keyboard layout every 10 seconds :(.


** Issues **

The applet kinda works. Good enough. For me. YMMV. Will vary. Feel free to pick
up these points, I probably will not take the time to fix them.

+ It doesn't collaborate with the regular keyboard switcher. Ensure that that
  one is set to use the first layout and do not touch it again.
+ Being just a button, you could not move it. So I added a widget with my
  initials that you can right-click on. It looks kinda ugly as well.
